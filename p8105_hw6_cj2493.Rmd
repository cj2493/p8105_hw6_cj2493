## Problem 1

Read in the homicide data:

```{r, read_hom}
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") 
```

Clean data accordingly: create city_state variable, a binary variable denoting whether the case was solved, omit cities who don't report victim race or were the product of a data entry mistake, modify victim race to white and non-white, and make sure victim_age is numeric.

```{r, hom_clean}
homicides = homicides %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("white"), c("non_white")),
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(victim_sex = factor(victim_sex, levels = c("Male", "Female")),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"))
```

For Baltimore, MD, use glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors


```{r, baltimore_glm}
baltimore_hom = homicides %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
 

balt_logistic = baltimore_hom %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Run glm for each of the cities in the dataset and extract the adjusted OR and CI for solving homicides comparing white and non-white victims.

```{r, pipe_glm}
nest_glm = homicides %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())),
         models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest()
```

## Problem 2

Load and clean birthweight data

```{r, read_birth}
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
birthweight = birthweight %>%
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace))
birthweight[!complete.cases(birthweight), ] 
```

There are 0 observations, so this shows that there are no missing values in the data set. 


Propose a regression model for birthweight:

```{r, bwt_model}
bwt_model_1 = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ mrace + fincome + malform + momage + pnumlbw + smoken, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy() 
```

Fit the models for comparison

```{r, comp_models}
lm_length_age = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy()

lm_interaction = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Compare the models

```{r, cross_val, warning = FALSE}

cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) %>%
  mutate(train = map(train, as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_df = cv_df %>%
  mutate(bwt_model_1    = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ mrace + fincome + malform + momage + pnumlbw + smoken, data = .)),
         lm_length_age  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .)),
         lm_interaction = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .))) %>%
  mutate(rmse_mod_1       = map2_dbl(bwt_model_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_length_age  = map2_dbl(lm_length_age, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_interaction = map2_dbl(lm_interaction, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>%
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>%
  gather(key = model, value = rmse) %>%
  mutate(model = str_replace(model, "rmse_", ""),
         model = fct_inorder(model)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()

```
