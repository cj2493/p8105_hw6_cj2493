Problem 1
---------

Read in the homicide data:

``` r
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Clean data accordingly: create city\_state variable, a binary variable denoting whether the case was solved, omit cities who don't report victim race or were the product of a data entry mistake, modify victim race to white and non-white, and make sure victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("white"), c("non_white")),
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(victim_sex = factor(victim_sex, levels = c("Male", "Female")),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"))
```

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

For Baltimore, MD, use glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors

``` r
baltimore_hom = homicides %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
 

balt_logistic = baltimore_hom %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```
