Problem 1
---------

Read in the homicide data:

``` r
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Clean data accordingly: create city\_state variable, a binary variable denoting whether the case was solved, omit cities who don't report victim race or were the product of a data entry mistake, modify victim race to white and non-white, and make sure victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("white"), c("non_white")),
         solve_status = ifelse(disposition == "Open/No arrest", c("unsolved"), c("solved"))) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("white", "non_white")))
```
