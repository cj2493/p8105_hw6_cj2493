Problem 1
---------

Read in the homicide data:

``` r
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Clean data accordingly: create city\_state variable, a binary variable denoting whether the case was solved, omit cities who don't report victim race or were the product of a data entry mistake, modify victim race to white and non-white, and make sure victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicides = homicides %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("white"), c("non_white")),
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(victim_sex = factor(victim_sex, levels = c("Male", "Female")),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"))
```

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

For Baltimore, MD, use glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors

``` r
baltimore_hom = homicides %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
 

balt_logistic = baltimore_hom %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Run glm for each of the cities in the dataset and extract the adjusted OR and CI for solving homicides comparing white and non-white victims.

``` r
nest_glm = homicides %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())),
         models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest()
```

Problem 2
---------

Load and clean birthweight data

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_integer(),
    ##   gaweeks = col_double(),
    ##   ppbmi = col_double(),
    ##   smoken = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
birthweight = birthweight %>%
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace))
birthweight[!complete.cases(birthweight), ] 
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 x 20
    ## # ... with 20 variables: babysex <fct>, bhead <int>, blength <int>,
    ## #   bwt <int>, delwt <int>, fincome <int>, frace <fct>, gaweeks <dbl>,
    ## #   malform <fct>, menarche <int>, mheight <int>, momage <int>,
    ## #   mrace <fct>, parity <int>, pnumlbw <int>, pnumsga <int>, ppbmi <dbl>,
    ## #   ppwt <int>, smoken <dbl>, wtgain <int>

There are 0 observations, so this shows that there are no missing values in the data set.

Propose a regression model for birthweight:

``` r
bwt_model_1 = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ mrace + fincome + malform + momage + pnumlbw + smoken, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy() 
```

Fit the models for comparison

``` r
lm_length_age = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy()

lm_interaction = birthweight %>%
  lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy()
```

Compare the models

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight, 100) %>%
  mutate(train = map(train, as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_df = cv_df %>%
  mutate(bwt_model_1    = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ mrace + fincome + malform + momage + pnumlbw + smoken, data = .)),
         lm_length_age  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .)),
         lm_interaction = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .))) %>%
  mutate(rmse_mod_1       = map2_dbl(bwt_model_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_length_age  = map2_dbl(lm_length_age, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
         rmse_interaction = map2_dbl(lm_interaction, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>%
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>%
  gather(key = model, value = rmse) %>%
  mutate(model = str_replace(model, "rmse_", ""),
         model = fct_inorder(model)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```
